When to use alt Attribute

> Decorative image, banner, block , alt can be null. like bar images, svg icons
> like svg icons
> Image inside icon
> When th image has descriptive label already <img src="/ss.jpg" alt="">

Provide info of Complex Images

> The image is embedded within the <figure> tag, The <figcaption> tag provides a longer or more detailed description or context for the image, which is displayed on the page.
> When you need to provide a detailed caption or context for the image.

Avoid Redundancy in Images

> Used to skip Alter so that the description gets read only once
> Use area described by and add ID to captions

text based images

> Always describe properly with all the information in the caption

Design Accessible Logo's

> dont start the alt text with "Image of"

Design Accessible Links

> Link Anti-patterns: Using span or div to create custom link Which are not accessible
> Removing HR from the ankle tag is a bad practice
> WCAG : A: Checklist Are The link text should be self-explanatory, Using button with same text is not recommended, Each button should explain its purpose
> best practices:
> Maintain contrast against its background
> Do not open in new tab, use target blank, since it makes difficult to come back
> Instead of using generic label , Make sure to use meaningful levels for example, instead of "click here", use "click here to learn more about this topic" text
